# CfileSnipper
This is a simple program to find all the required files used by a C-program even if they are defined in their header files..!
Please pass the c program file name(eg: xyz.c) and associated header filenames with path as command line arguments.

The program contain function to find the associated header files.

It will return the associated files in a list and will write the input files in a file as well.

Feel free to sugest changes and help me to improve this....!
Thank You...!
